# TwitterSampleDemo

Notes:

1. This is a working sample, but I am using a local Secrets file for the Redis connection string, and the Twitter API key and secret.  If you would like these items, please email me at sean@seanalisea.com.

2. To run locally, configure the solution for multiple startup projects, starting with the Worker, and then the Web API.

3. There is a working solution deployed to my Azure account, which can be found at:  https://twittersample.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html
